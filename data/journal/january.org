* January Training Log

** 01-19-2023
Went on an evening bike ride to downtown and back. Previously my left knee was
a little sore when changing to certain standing positions, but felt mostly good
tonight. It's interesting that on flats, I have a hard time getting my heart rate
into zone 3 but on any hill, I got almost to zone 4.

** 01-18-2023
Went on an evening job. Since it was dark, I ran on the greenway. Heart rate stayed
within zone 2 and zone 3 most of the way so I was able to jog continuously through mile 1.
Calves felt a little tight and felt like I was exerting myself more than previous runs.

** 01-17-2023
Went on an afternoon jog. Good sensations in the legs, but felt heavy afterward. Was winded quickly
when going up hill so lots of walking to achieve my goal of training mostly in heart rates zones 2
and 3 (preference for 3).
